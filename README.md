<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## BUSSINESS REQUIREMENT

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached us for help with this new project. We have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. We have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.

## RECOMMENDATION

After Analysing IMDB dataset we got the following points: 
1) A total of 1078 movies were produced in the year 2019 in ‘Drama’ genre. RSVP Movies should focus on ‘Drama’ genre for the next project. 

2) ‘Action’ movies have the highest average duration than comes ‘Romance’ movies. RSVP Movies can focus more on these 2 genre for the next project. 

3) ‘Taapsee Pannu’ can be chosen as the actress for their next project based on total votes received and average ratings. 

4) The top 3 directors are ‘Josh Oreck’ (1st rank), ‘Joe Russo’ (2nd rank) and ‘Anthony Russo’ (3rd rank). These 3 directors can be hired for the next project. 

5) The top 3 Production Houses are ‘Marvel Studios’ (1st rank), ‘Twentieth Century Fox’ (2nd rank) and ‘Warner Bros’ (3rd rank). These 3 Production Houses can be preferred more. 

6) ‘Vijay Sethupathi’ can be hired as the additional actor for their next project based on total votes.
